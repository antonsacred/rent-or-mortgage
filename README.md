# Rent or Mortgage Guide

An interactive rent-versus-buy calculator that helps you compare the long-term costs of renting an apartment versus purchasing a home. Tweak purchase price, down payment, interest rates, appreciation, rent increases, and investment returns to see detailed projections.

## Tech stack

- Vite + React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- React Router, React Query, Zod, and other utilities listed in `package.json`

## Getting started

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit the app at http://localhost:5173 (default Vite port) and adjust the sliders to evaluate scenarios.

## Available scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the Vite dev server with hot reloading.
- `npm run build` – create a production build in `dist/`.
- `npm run preview` – serve the production build locally.
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint with the project rules.

## Project structure

- `src/pages/Index.tsx` renders the calculator.
- `src/components/Calculator.tsx` contains the input controls and shared state.
- `src/components/CalculatorResults.tsx` visualizes monthly cash flow and cumulative totals.
- `src/lib` and `src/hooks` hold supporting utilities.

## Deployment

Any static hosting provider (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.) can serve the contents of the `dist/` folder generated by `npm run build`. Upload the folder or wire it into your CI/CD pipeline of choice.
